Examine changes in mortgage portfolio after the financial meltdown in 2008. 

Background:

Before the financial meltdown in the third quarter of 2008, many people purchased houses for investment purposes, i.e., they expected the property value to go up quickly so that they could profit from reselling. Lenders also applied very lax policies in underwriting, i.e., no need for income verification or for down payment when reviewing loan applications.

Since the financial meltdown, the US government imposed more strict policies for underwriting. For example, the requirement for FICO score has become higher, and income verification is needed.
